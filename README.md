## Installation 🛠️

Get DEBoot running locally or tweak it yourself:

### Prerequisites ✅
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) 🌍
- Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript know-how 🧑‍💻

### Steps 🚶‍♂️
1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chess-Base/Deboot-Society.git
   cd Deboot-Society
   ```

2. **Run Locally**:
   - Open `index.html` in your browser for the landing page, or `chat.html` to chat away 🗣️.
   - Some features (like file uploads) might need a server tweak.

3. **Optional Server**:
   - Use a simple tool like Python’s HTTP server:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Visit `http://localhost:8000`.

4. **Dependencies** 📦:
   - All goodies (Font Awesome, Prism.js, MathJax) load via CDNs—no extra setup unless you tweak it!

5. **API Magic** 🔌:
   - Runs on Puter.js for AI power. Swap it out with your fave API in `script.js` if you want.
